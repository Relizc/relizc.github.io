        <ul>
            <li>There are some expectations, such as alogrithms like DFS which you have to use recursion.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Always provide annotations and explaination about what a function do. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO IT FOR EVERY LINE, JUST EVERY FUNCTION
    </li>
    <li>

    <li>
        Make sure your variable names are comprehendable and make sense.

    <li>
        NEVER code useless variables, functions, loops, statements... If you add a function, make sure you use it somewhere.

        Keep time complexity as low as possible.
