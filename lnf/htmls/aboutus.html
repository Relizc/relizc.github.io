        <h2 style = "padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 150px; font-family: Courier;">Why did we create this platform:</h2>
        <p style = "padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 150px; font-family: Courier;">We are 7th grade middle school students from Basis International Shenzhen. We participated in the pitch perfect project - a project 
        that has the purpose of improving the new campus that we are going to move in next semester. Our goal is to improve the lost and found 
        system in our school. <br><br> <b>The current lost and found has many existing problems:</b> <br> 1. The current lost and found system is very small:
       it is only consisted of one desk and 15 small boxes.<br> 2. The current lost and found system is too unorganized: things are not sorted properly.
       <br>3. People who lost things could not communicate effectively with the finders.</p>
       <p style = "padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 150px; font-family: Courier;">Thus, we decided that we are going to refine the lost and found system of our school.</p>
