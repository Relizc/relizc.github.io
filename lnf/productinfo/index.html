        <h3>The main purpose of this online communication platform is to
        assist the people to communicate better when they are finding items.
        Statistics of our school have shown that people tend to lose objects easily,
        whether it's school-related or not, in the campus. Just having a storage system is not
        good enough, and we certainly can't make everyone asking questions in the school channels,
        so here we are: an online communication platform! Made by AVE.
